#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Time Complexity: O(n)
because: (10 * 10 * 10) / (10 * 10) = 10
every iteration a gets added with n * n until a is equal or bigger than n * n * n

b)


c)
Time Complexity: O(n)
This a recursive function.
When we call bunnyEars(5)
the function returs bunnyEars(4)
then bunnyEars(3)
then bunnyEars(2)
then bunnyEars(1)
then bunyEars(0) and we trigger the base case :
if bunnies == 0: return 0
